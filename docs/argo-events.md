Here's a brief explanation of each:

fs.inotify.max_user_instances

This setting determines the maximum number of inotify instances that a single user can create.
Inotify is used to monitor file system events, such as file creation, modification, or deletion.
Increasing this value allows more inotify instances to be created, which can be useful if you have applications that heavily rely on filesystem monitoring.


fs.inotify.max_user_watches

This setting determines the maximum number of files and directories that can be monitored by all inotify instances for a single user.
Increasing this value allows more files and directories to be monitored, which can be useful if you have applications that need to track a large number of filesystem events.



To check the current values of these settings, you can use the following commands in the terminal:
Copy# Check the value of fs.inotify.max_user_instances
sysctl -a | grep fs.inotify.max_user_instances

# Check the value of fs.inotify.max_user_watches
sysctl -a | grep fs.inotify.max_user_watches
These commands will output the current values of the respective settings.
If you need to change these settings, you can do so by modifying the corresponding sysctl configuration file (usually /etc/sysctl.conf) and adding the following lines:
Copyfs.inotify.max_user_instances=256
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
After making the changes, you'll need to run sudo sysctl -p to apply the new settings.
Keep in mind that these settings are system-wide, so changing them may have implications for other applications running on the system. It's generally recommended to only adjust these values if you have a specific need for it, and to carefully consider the impact on the overall system performance.
